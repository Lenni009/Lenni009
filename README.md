# Hello there!

## About me
I'm Lenni. I do frontend web dev as a hobby.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a wiki page creator for the [No Man's Sky wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky_Wiki), and also helping with bug testing the [Assistant for NMS](https://github.com/AssistantNMS) app and websites. I regularly come up with random side projects when I procrastinate on anything. These side projects are all the other websites I made.
- 🌱 I'm currently using VueJS with TypeScript, but also want to learn some more frameworks (NextJS, Svelte...) in the future.
- 💬 Ask me about MediaWiki
- 📫 How to reach me: lenni009 on Discord
- ⚡ Controversial opinions: OOP sucks, jQuery sucks, NodeJS sucks (Deno is better, use Deno!) JS frameworks suck (each one in their own way), vanilla JS is the best way to write a web app (TS also sucks, just because something is the industry standard doesn't mean it can't suck!).
- 🧬 The meaning of life is to make the code linter happy.
- 🎞️ Fun fact: My day job is being a video editor

Many of my projects are stored in GitHub organizations instead of my profile. You can find all my web apps on my [index page](https://lenni009.github.io/).
