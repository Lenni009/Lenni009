# Hello there!

## About me
I'm Lenni. I do frontend web dev as a hobby.

- 🔭 I'm currently building a bunch of projects for problems that I either encounter regularly, or that I simply want to solve with code, even if they're not frequent problems. You learn best by building things, and there's a lot to learn!
- 🌱 My framework of choice is VueJS with TypeScript, but I also want to learn some more frameworks (NextJS, Angular, Svelte...) in the future.
- 💬 Ask me about MediaWiki
- 📫 How to reach me: lenni009 on Discord
- 🧬 The meaning of life is to make the code linter happy.
- 🎞️ Fun fact: My current job is being a video editor

Many of my projects are stored in GitHub organizations instead of my profile. You can find most of my web apps on my [index page](https://lenni009.github.io/).
