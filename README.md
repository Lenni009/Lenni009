# Hello there!

## About me
I'm Lenni. I do frontend web dev as a hobby.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a wiki page creator for the [No Man's Sky wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky_Wiki), and also helping with bug testing the [Assistant for NMS](https://github.com/AssistantNMS) app and websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently using vanilla JS, but also want to learn some frameworks (VueJS, NextJS, Svelte...) and other languages like Typescript in the future.
- 💬 Ask me about MediaWiki
- 📫 How to reach me: Lenni#4423 on Discord
- ⚡ Controversial opinions: OOP sucks, jQuery sucks, JS frameworks suck (each one in their own way), vanilla JS is the best way to write a web app.
- 🧬 The meaning of life is to make the code linter happy.
- 🎞️ Fun fact: My day job is being a video editor
